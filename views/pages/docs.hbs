        <br>
        <br>
        <small class=''>This command will create a package.json file for us, from where we will be able to
            manage our installed packages and also control the version of our application.</small>

        <code class='code'>npm install express mongoose cors nodemon</code>
        <br>
        <br>
        <small class=''>Here, with the help of this command, we will be able to install both at a single time.
            The express will use to write NodeJS code and set up endpoints and Mongoose will be used to create a
            database model and save data. The CORS is referred to as Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing which will help us to
            build a connection with the frontend. The nodemon help to restart our server after everychange</small>

        <small class=''>After connecting the MongoDB database, it is time to create our database schema model.
            That will give the shape of the data and define how the data will be stored in the database. We will create
            it into a separate folder and will name it Model and inside the model folder, we will create a folder named
            PhoneBook.js Inside this folder, we will create a simple database schema model. See the below code
            example:</small>

        <script class="gists" src="https://gist.github.com/gokulhans/d409a440b77f4eed74ebfd604c0c34ab.js"></script>
        <small class=''>Here, you can see that we have created a schema model where we will store two types of
            data. One is the name which type is String and another one is the phone which type is Number We also set
            them as required: true as a result, it will throw a mongo error if any fields remain empty. Finally, we have
            exported this schema model so that we can use it by importing it into another file.</small>

        <small class=''>We have successfully completed our BASE application using the MERN stack. In this whole
            tutorial, we have covered, how you can start a nodejs server and connect it with mongoose.And how to start
            react server. If you have completed this tutorial, now you are ready to build your own CRUD application that
            will be based on the MERN stack. But there are a lot more things to do. Reffer below</small>
